# Python Upgrade Instructions for liquid-audio

## Current Situation
- Current Python: 3.11.9
- Required Python: 3.12+ (liquid-audio requires Python >=3.12)

1. Download Python 3.12 from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/
2. During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"
3. Use python3.12 or py -3.12 to use the new version

### Option 2: Upgrade existing Python installation
1. Backup any critical virtual environments
2. Install Python 3.12 over existing installation
3. Reinstall required packages

### After Python Upgrade
```bash
# Create new virtual environment with Python 3.12
python3.12 -m venv venv-liquid-audio
venv-liquid-audio\Scripts\activate

# Install liquid-audio
pip install liquid-audio
```

## Notes
- liquid-audio appears to be in early development (alpha/beta versions)
